Tools for Checking the Validity of a Model

#Residuals

$$
\hat{e}=Y-\hat{Y}=Y-X\hat{\beta},
$$
$$
\hat{\beta}={(X'X)}^{-1}X'Y.
$$
#Leverage of points

(1)Hat matrix:

$$
\hat{Y}=HY, \ H= X{(X'X)}^{-1}X'.
$$
(2)Note: $H'H=HH=H$.

Identifying leverage points:

Usually, the rule for identifying leverage points is $h_{ii}>2*average(h_{ii})=\frac{2*(p+1)}{n}$, where $h_{ii}$ denotes the $i^{th}$ diagonal element of $H$.



#Standardized residuals

$$
r_i=\frac{\hat{e_i}}{s\sqrt{1-h_{ii}}},
$$
since $Var(\hat{e})=\sigma^2[1-H]$, $Var(\hat{e_i})=\sigma^2[1-h_{ii}]$.

(1)Identifying outliers:

Usually, the rule for identifying outliers is $r_{i}>2$ or $r_{i}<-2$.


#Cook's Distance
Consider both the location of the point in x space and the response variable in measuring influence.
$$
D_{i}  = \frac{1}{p} \left [ \frac{(y_{i}-\hat{y_{i} }  )}{\hat{\sigma  }(1-h_{ii} ) ^{1/2}  } \right ]^{2}\frac{h_{ii} }{1-h_{ii} }   
$$
(1)Usually points with $D_{i}>1$ are considered as influencial points.
